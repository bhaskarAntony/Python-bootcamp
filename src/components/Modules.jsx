First will understand the powerful libraries that is supported by python, how to analyze your code in term of time complexity and how to make use of User Defined Functions helps to solve coding problems. Later, will let you to understand underlying concepts of Turtle library functions. Each module builds on the next, and is designed to enter the job market as a developer.
